Bugs:
1. Filter DepreciationValue (Not entity property)

Todo:
1. Implement Secure Delete functions (Check if children are set to object)	2h
	-> Articles	DONE
	-> User	
6. Print grids									1h
7. Create all reports								5h
8. Create own filter control:
	Why?: The grids are really slow with loading and you can only print the visible items.
	Since you need to virtually load/paging to speed up the grids you need to retrieve manually the filtered datasource from db

	How?: Textboxes which are the filters where you can enter data.
	On setting filters, FilterExpression will be created -> (Name) Like what ever as SQL statement.
	This will executed then and retrieve filtereddatasource.
	This way you can print all items plus you don't need to convert them.
