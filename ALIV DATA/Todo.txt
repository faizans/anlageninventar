Bugs:
1. Filter DepreciationValue (Not entity property)				2h	DONE

Todo:
1. Implement Secure Delete functions (Check if children are set to object)	2h
	-> Articles	DONE
	-> User	
6. Print grids									1h
7. Create all reports								5h	NOT NEEDED NOW
8. Create own filter control (OPTIONAL):
	Why?: The grids are really slow with loading and you can only print the visible items.
	Since you need to virtually load/paging to speed up the grids you need to retrieve manually the filtered datasource from db

	How?: Textboxes which are the filters where you can enter data.
	On setting filters, FilterExpression will be created -> (Name) Like what ever as SQL statement.
	This will executed then and retrieve filtereddatasource.
	This way you can print all items plus you don't need to convert them.
9. Login form									3h	DONE (Styling needed)
10.Reverse deleted objects							1h	DONE
11.Delete groups if nomore articles are bound to				1h 	DONE
